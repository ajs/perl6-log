Loging for Perl 6
-----------------

This project is intended to be a simple base-class for logging
in Perl 6. Some logging features in other languages make sense,
I think to move out to other places. For example, if you want
rotated logs, it probably makes sense to have a file handle
that rotates its output and then pass it to Log. There could be
a wrapper class for that if you like. Of course, on some platforms
doing your own log-rotating might be considered antisocial, YMMV.

Use 'ufo' to generate the Makefile for this project.
See http://github.com/masak/ufo for more details.

You need the DateTime::Utils module from temporal-utils for this
module to work.

=== Example Use Case ===

use Log;
our $logger = Log.get_logger(:level(Log.levels<debug>), :facility('myprog'))
$logger.debug("OK, I set up a logger");
$logger.critical("But now I give up");
